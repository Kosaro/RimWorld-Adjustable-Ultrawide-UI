Are you using a wide display and find the UI on the edges to be too far away? Use this mod to move it closer to the middle!

Adjust UI position in the mod settings.

I modified all the UI elements on the edge of the screen during typical gameplay. I didn't touch anything in the main menu nor dev mode.

#### Mod compatibility and issues
So far I've added support for:
* RimHUD
* FoodAlert (Continued)
* Vanilla Achievements Expanded
* Vanilla Factions Expanded - Empire
* Vanilla Psycasts Expanded

If you find any bugs or compatibility issues, let me know.
