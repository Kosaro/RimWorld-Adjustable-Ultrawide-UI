Are you using a wide display and find the UI on the edges to be too far away? Use this mod to move it closer to the middle!

Adjust UI position in the mod settings. If you're using three monitors, turn it down to 33% to have all your UI on the center screen while still playing Rimworld on all three screens.

I modified all the UI elements on the edge of the screen during typical gameplay. I didn't touch anything in the main menu nor dev mode.

If you find any compatibility issues or any UI elements I missed let me know.
